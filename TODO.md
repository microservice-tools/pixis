# **TODO**

### DOCUMENTATION
- google style

### TESTING
- pytest
- Command line tests:
    - pixis
    - pixis -b buildfiles/build1.py
    - pixis --build buildfiles/build1.py
    - pixis -o OUT
    - pixis --output OUT
    - pixis -t mytemplates
    - pixis --templates mytemplates
- Template Context tests
- openapi.py functions unit test
- config.py unit test
- emit_template unit test


### VERBOSE
- possibly using the python logger module
- print which files we're generating, which templates we're using, where we're generating them to, etc.
- once hash checking and file ignore is in then also print out what files we're not generating

### FINISH SCHEMAS!!!!!!!!
- finish property class
- make sure everything from the spec is represented
- check in with James about what we were talking about (getType being the schema handler)

---
## Templates
- sorting functions/classes alphabetically
- double check module imports!!!
- angular2
    - encodeURIcomponent part needs to be fixed
    - POST methods aren't being generated correctly
---
## Alternate servers

## Additional languages
